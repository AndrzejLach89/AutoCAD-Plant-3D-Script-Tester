#PlantScriptTest  

##About  
This tool was created for debugging Plant 3D part scripts during developement. It makes it possible to check for script errors without  
running Plant 3D, registering scripts and restarting it over and over again.  

This script covers all (as far as I know) the primitives and their methods.  

##Manual  
Comment all the imports and parameter section in your script file, then import * from this file to your script and invoke script function    
at the end of the script to check for errors. If no problems were found, continue with checking your script in Plant 3D.
